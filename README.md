## Dmitri Kent So's Responsive Portfolio

I've created a responsive webpage to show-case some information about myself. Ive also added a gallery of photos linking to completed and deployed projects. There is also a contact form incase anyone should need to contact me! Just enter you name, email-address , and leave a message if neccesary! You can submit the form by clicking the "submit" button on the bottom of the form.

Three seperate html files were created for this project. All html sheets source frame works from external souurces which I've linked below. I do not claim any credit for majority of the styling! The style.css file contained was created by me. I can only take credit for the styling in the stylesheet provided.
